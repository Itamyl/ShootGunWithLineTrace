I do Shootgun with Linetrace system.

こんにちは! Hello!

I do shootgun with linetrace.

First we need create a new project. // First Person Temple but you can add your Third person or something!

After we need to Gun First Person have gun we can use this.

Concent > First Person > BluePrints > BP_Weapon_Component if you guys dont see it go to back concent and research BP_Weapon_Component

After we need linetrace system so i expalain in my project.

I added an enemy and added a HP-DAMAGE system. I added physics to the line trace. If we hit the boxes, they move. // You can make a ball game with guns using this. Finally, a shotgun is not a rifle. I added a 1 second delay and it became a nice shootgun. And I created veriables ​​for you where you can add the number of bullets, the dispersion of the bullet and the weight of the bullet.

What I couldn't explain here, I added as a comment in the game.

Thanks! どうもありがとうございます。
